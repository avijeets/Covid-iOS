# Covid-iOS

This application breaks down COVID-19 cases based on the number of positive cases and those who have been hospitalized, deceased, recovered, all categorized by states/regions in the USA. The data is being pulled from https://covidtracking.com/.

This project uses SwiftUI (which outputs to iOS and watchOS), GitHub Actions as a CI platform and adheres to the MVVM architecture.
